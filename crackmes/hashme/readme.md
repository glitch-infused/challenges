I have downloaded a new app, but it keeps asking me to buy a license for the 'pro-version' of the app. Normally in this case i would look for a FOSS that has the same functionality, but I could not find any.

After some analyzation of the app I found an interesting program. The program seems to be some kind of license check. However in the program we could not find a license key not in plaintext, not obfuscated and also not encrypted.

The develloppers of the app have found a better way to keep us from finding the license. Can you find a valid license?

## Goal

The goal is to find a valid license key and get an unmodified version of the program to print "Access granted!".
