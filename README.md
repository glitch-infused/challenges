# Challenges

Hello world! These are the challenges I made over the years. What kind of challenges, you may ask. Challenges like CTF's (Capture The Flag), crackme's, and various other security/cryptography related challenges.

## FAQ

### What is a challenge?

A challenge can be a lot of different things: some source code to analyze, a binary file to inspect or in the future maybe a host and port to connect to.

### How do I know I have solved it?

If you are solving a CTF, you are done when you find the flag. If you are cracking a crackme then you are done when you found a valid license key or if you have reached a target. When it's not clear what the goal of a challenge is the description will set a goal.
